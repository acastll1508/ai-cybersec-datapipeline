# AI & Data Analytics for Offensive Cybersecurity
Read this in Spanish → [README.es.md](README.es.md)


This repository is a professional hands-on laboratory focused in the application of:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Analytics
- Offensive Cybersecurity Automation

Applied to **realistic cyberattack log simulations**, malicious infraestructure detection, and network traffic classification using publicly available security datasets.

This project is designed as a portfolio-oriented path to transition into roles such as:

- AI Security Analyst
- Security Data Analyst
- SOC Analyst with Machine Learning 
- Offensive Security Automation Engineer

---

## Professional Objective

To specialize in the application of Machine Learning and Data Science techniques for:

## How to run projects 

This repository is organized as a **monorepo** containing multiple
independent and self-contained projects.

Each project must be executed from its own directory inside the 
`projects/` folder.

### Example: Project 1 - Cyberattack Log Analysis 

`` bash 
cd projects/project1-log-analysis 
python -m src.load_data
